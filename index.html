                    <h1>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h1>
                    <li>
                        I chose to redesign <a target="_blank" href="https://www.papapasqualespizzeria.com/">Papa Pasquale's Pizzeria</a> 
                        because many restaurants have subpar design, but it's often small, local businesses 
                        that suffer from this the most. Most small businesses, especially those run by older people, don't have 
                        the means or the resources to a well designed website, which is unfortunate since it takes a lot for 
                        these businesses to survive. This is a site my friends and I frequented during covid, so despite the 
                        subpar food, there is some sentimental attachment.

                    <h2>
                        The problems I've noticed are as listed:
                    </h2>
                    <li>
                        usability: each button's style is inconsistent with each other. when viewing a menu, which should be one of the main 
                        points, is hindered by the menu being a small pdf of the menu. There are two versions of the menu, which are accessed 
                        by “menu” button and the “order online” button, but they're of completely different styles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        efficiency: everything is on one page and doesn't involve much scrolling, which is nice, but the space isn't used efficiently.
                        the address, hours, and phone number is duplicated too many times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        learnability: it'll take some trial and error to figure out which button will direct you to your intended action, but given 
                        the scale of the site, it's not too bad. it may cause some annoyance, which could be costly for a small business
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        memorability: unique logo, but otherwise bland design
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        conceptual model: it seems like the designer thinks the user will mainly want to order online, hence the larger centered button 
                        that doesn't fit the style of the other buttons
                    </li>

                    <h2>
                        Accessibility
                    </h2>

                    <li>
                        I agreed with most of the the WebAIM WAVE findings, notably the inconsistency between heading sizes and their importance to the
                        items around it
                    </li>
